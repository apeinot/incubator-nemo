## Architectural overview (optional, as one item for P+)

## Selected issue(s)

Title: Refactor getInternal(Main/Additional)OutputMap in TaskExecutor

URL: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NEMO-253

There are two separate methods to get main or additional output maps in TaskExecutor. The refactor task consist to merge the both beacause they share a lot of code.

## Onboarding experience

Everything build as documented if we respect all the prerequisities.


## Requirements affected by functionality being refactored

## Existing test cases relating to refactored code

## The refactoring carried out

(Link to) a UML diagram and its description

## Relation to software architecture

Our refactoring consists in merging the getInternalAdditionalOutputMap() and the getInternalMainOutputs() function to a single function, so that the return value is always a map mapping an output tag to a list of NextIntraTaskOperatorInfo objects, instead of like in the latter case, where a NextIntraTaskOperatorInfo list is returned instead.

## Test logs
